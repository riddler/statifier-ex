# Next Issue

Pick the next unblocked, unclaimed bead, claim it so other worktrees skip it,
cut its worktree branch via `/new-worktree`, and hand the bead to `/work` in
that worktree. Beads is the only tracker here (ADR-0007) - there is no external
issue system to promote to or reconcile against. Issue state syncs across
machines through `refs/dolt/data` on git origin (`bd dolt pull` / `bd dolt
push`); `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export, never the sync channel.

## Modes

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **`--auto` present** -> **agent-auto mode**: atomically claim the top ready
  item and proceed without confirmations. For unattended agents.
- **Otherwise** -> **manual mode** (the default): always present choices and let
  the user pick. Never auto-select in manual mode, even if only one item is
  ready - show it and confirm.

Everything else in `$ARGUMENTS` maps to `bd ready`'s native filter flags
(`-p/--priority`, `-l/--label`/`--label-any`/`--exclude-label`,
`-t/--type`/`--exclude-type`, `--parent`, ...) and is passed through to
whichever call runs, so both modes scope identically. Re-verify against
`bd ready --help` if these drift.

## Steps

0. **Refresh beads (best-effort).** The Dolt DB syncs via `refs/dolt/data` on
   git origin (github.com/riddler/statifier-ex), so pull the latest issue state
   before picking - another machine or agent may have claimed or closed work:
   ```bash
   bd dolt pull 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   Non-fatal if offline; the local DB is then the best available view. On a
   fresh clone with no `.beads/embeddeddolt/`, run `bd bootstrap` instead - it
   clones the issue history from origin and wires the Dolt remote.

0.5. **Clean up merged worktrees (best-effort).** Invoke
   **`/cleanup-worktrees`**. Picking up new work is the natural moment for it:
   the previous branch has usually landed by now, and its worktree and local
   branch are still sitting there. Detection is GitHub PR state, never git
   ancestry - the repo allows rebase merging only, so a merged branch is never
   an ancestor of `main`.

   Like the sync steps, this must never gate the pickup. If `gh` is
   unauthenticated or offline, `/cleanup-worktrees` stops on its own and reports;
   carry on picking work regardless.

   **Run this every invocation, even if `/cleanup-worktrees` already ran earlier
   in the session.** "Already ran this session" is not the same claim as "ran
   immediately before this pickup" - a branch can land on `origin/main` in
   between. This skill has no live-worktree survey downstream to go stale from
   a skipped 0.5 (`/next-issues` does; see its step 0.5/2 for that hardening),
   but re-running here is still cheap and keeps a dead worktree from sitting
   alongside the one this step is about to create.

1. **Pick and claim.**

   **Manual mode:**
   ```bash
   bd ready --json [FILTERS]
   ```
   Present the top few candidates (id, title, type, priority, one-line why-now
   drawn from its epic/dependencies if obvious) and let the user pick or confirm
   the top one. Then claim:
   ```bash
   bd update <id> --claim
   ```

   **Agent-auto mode** - one atomic call, no read-then-claim race:
   ```bash
   bd ready --claim --json [FILTERS]
   ```
   Non-empty -> `[0]` is the claimed bead (status already `in_progress`); read
   `.id` from it.

   **Empty (`[]`)** in either mode -> nothing ready and unclaimed. Do not
   auto-file. Report it, show `bd blocked` so it is clear what is waiting on
   what, and stop (skip every step below). In manual mode, offer
   `/create-issue` as the way to file something new.

1.5. **Publish the claim (best-effort).** The claim is the lock, but it only
   locks what other machines can see - push it right after claiming:
   ```bash
   bd dolt push 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   Non-fatal if offline (agents in the same checkout's worktrees share the DB
   directly and see the claim regardless); it publishes on the next push.

2. **Compute the branch name** `<id>-<slug>`. Kebab-case the bead title into a
   short slug - 2-4 distinctive words, not a full transcription
   (`/new-worktree` refuses to guess one, so this skill must produce the full
   name). Manual mode: present it for confirmation.

   The name is fixed at creation and never renamed afterwards, even if the
   branch grows to carry more beads (ADR-0010).

3. **Read the bead.** `bd show <id>` - description, acceptance, dependencies,
   notes. This still has to happen before the worktree is stood up: the branch
   slug in step 2 comes from the title, and an epic or a malformed bead is
   something to catch while the only cost is a claim to reverse, not after a
   worktree and a tmux window exist for it. Sizing the work is **not** what this
   read is for - that happens in the worktree, in `/work`.

4. **Stand up the worktree, seeded with `/work`.** Invoke
   **`/new-worktree <id>-<slug> -- /work <id> --auto`** - it cuts the branch off
   `main`, creates `../statifier-ex-worktrees/<id>-<slug>`, warms `deps/`,
   `_build/`, and the dialyzer PLT, verifies the loop profile is green, and
   opens a tmux window running a Claude session on that seed.

   **The seed is the same for every bead, by design.** It is uniform precisely
   *because* sizing is not this skill's job: choosing between research, a plan,
   and implementing directly needs the codebase, and this session has only the
   bead's description. The seeded session has the worktree - it can read the
   modules the bead names before it decides. `/work` sizes the job there and
   drives the stages, so nothing is lost by not deciding here; the decision is
   simply made where the evidence is.

5. **Hand off - do not do the work here.** The seeded session in the tmux
   window owns the issue from this point. Doing it in this session as well is
   two sessions editing one worktree.

   **Report**: the chosen bead, that it was claimed, the branch and worktree
   created, the quality-check result from `/new-worktree`, and the tmux window
   to jump to.

## Guidelines

- Claim before worktree, always - the claim is the lock (ADR-0010). Never
  create the worktree for an unclaimed bead.
- Sync and cleanup steps (0, 0.5 and 1.5) are best-effort and must never gate
  the claim: if
  `bd dolt pull`/`push` is slow, errors, or the machine is offline, proceed -
  they retry on the next run. Never abort pickup on a sync failure.
- Manual mode confirms the pick and the branch name before anything mutates the
  repo; the claim itself is cheap to reverse (`bd update <id> --status open`).
- Discovered work found while picking is filed with `bd q` and linked
  `discovered-from`, not chased now.
- Compose with `/create-issue`, `/new-worktree` and `/work` rather than
  duplicating their logic.
- **This skill picks and claims; it neither sizes nor implements.** Selection
  is all that happens here. `/work`, in the worktree, sizes the job and drives
  it - research, plan, or straight to implementation - because that session is
  the one that can read the code. Doing any of that here as well is how one
  issue gets worked twice.
- Re-verify exact `bd` flags against `bd ready --help` if this drifts -
  `bd ready --claim --json` and `bd update --claim` are confirmed current as of
  the bd version in use (2026-08).
