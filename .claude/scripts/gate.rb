# Gate wraps `mix gate.verify` and `mix quality --format json --report -`,
# serving /commit, /merge-request, /implement-plan, and /work. See
# docs/plans/260806-st-hzf-skill-mechanics-scripts.md Phase 7 - this is the
# most constrained script in the set: it must make the gate easier to read
# without making it easier to weaken.
#
# Three rules that are load-bearing, not incidental:
#
# 1. `data.skipped_stages` always stays in the payload, for every skip,
#    whatever the reason. CLAUDE.md: "a skipped stage is not a passing one" -
#    a summary that drops it launders exactly what that rule protects.
#
#    Whether a skip *blocks* is a second question, and CLAUDE.md answers it
#    in the same breath: "the reason says whether the gap is in this run or
#    in what the project checks at all." Those are different failures.
#
#    - A gap **in this run** blocks. Dialyzer skipping because the PLT is
#      missing, Tests skipping because compilation half-failed: the gate was
#      asked to measure something and could not, so `ok` is false.
#    - A gap in **what the project checks at all** is reported, not blocked.
#      `:doctor not installed`, `:gettext not installed`, `adr_judge
#      disabled in .quality.exs` are standing project properties, true on
#      every run including the ones that were green when the policy was
#      written. Blocking on them makes `ok` false on *every* full gate run
#      forever, which does not enforce the rule - it deletes the signal, and
#      the first thing anyone does with a check that is always red is stop
#      reading it.
#
#    `PROJECT_LEVEL_SKIP_RE` draws that line, and it is deliberately narrow:
#    anything it does not match blocks. Adding a pattern to it is the same
#    class of decision as editing the gate config, so it belongs in review.
#    This is still stricter than `mix gate.verify`'s `data.attested`, which
#    mirrors only ADR-0011's narrowing test.
# 2. This script accepts exactly one profile argument, `--profile loop`, and
#    forwarding it always sets `attested: false`. Every other `--profile`
#    value, and `--skip`/`--quick` in any form, are simply not options this
#    parser defines - OptionParser rejects them as usage errors (exit 2)
#    before any envelope is built. There is no flag this script owns that
#    narrows what `mix quality` runs beyond that one case.
# 3. `data.sabotage.missing` and `data.gate_guard` are reports. Neither ever
#    flips `ok`, and there is no code path anywhere in this file that writes
#    docs/quality-gate-changes.md - see test/contract_test.rb.
