# WorktreeCleanup is the /cleanup-worktrees sweep, minus the two pieces that
# stay at the skill boundary on purpose (see
# docs/plans/260806-st-hzf-skill-mechanics-scripts.md Phase 4):
#
# - Closing beads: this script never calls `bd close`. It emits
#   `data.beads_to_close`, gathered from `pr_state.rb beads` over each merged
#   PR's commits, and the SKILL.md performs the close - `bd close` is
#   agent-authorized only against a verified merge, and keeping the call at
#   the skill boundary is what keeps that trigger visible.
# - tmux quiescing: Phase 5's script, invoked by the SKILL.md between this
#   script's check phase and its removal phase.
#
# Merge detection goes entirely through pr_state.rb (via worktree_survey.rb,
# which already queries it per worktree) - never git ancestry. This repo
# allows rebase merging only, so a merged branch's tip is never an ancestor
# of main; see pr_state.rb's header comment for the verified failure modes.
#
# Never remove a dirty worktree, and never delete a branch `git worktree
# remove` itself would refuse - that refusal is a feature. This script has no
# forceful override of either refusal anywhere in it.
