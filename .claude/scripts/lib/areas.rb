# Areas is the batching policy over a project's `area:` label vocabulary -
# the label set, the lands-alone rule, and the always-batchable escape
# hatch. All three are manifest data (`beads.areas.*`), documented for this
# repo in docs/workflow.md:147-191.
#
# It holds no inference from file paths: an area label is a prediction
# written before the work exists, so deriving one from a diff would invert
# the design (docs/plans/260806-st-hzf-skill-mechanics-scripts.md Phase 6).
# select_batch.rb is the only caller.
