# Refs is the single definition site for extracting bead ids from the commit
# trailer line the project uses (`Refs:` here; the key is manifest data, see
# `commits.trailer.key`). Before this extraction the same pattern was written
# twice, independently: `/merge-request` SKILL.md (over
# `git log origin/main..HEAD --pretty=%B`) and `/cleanup-worktrees` SKILL.md
# (over `gh pr view <n> --json commits --jq '.commits[].messageBody'`). A
# drift between the two would mean a PR body's `Closes` lines and the beads
# `/cleanup-worktrees` actually closes disagree - see
# docs/plans/260806-st-hzf-skill-mechanics-scripts.md Phase 2.
#
# The anchor (`^Refs:`) is load-bearing, not tidiness: a commit body
# routinely names other beads in prose (citing a design note, crediting a
# discovery), and an unanchored match would close every one of them. See the
# 146c69f fixture in test/refs_test.rb for a real example.
#
# The bead id shape and the trailer key both come from the manifest, so this
# module carries no project constants of its own. Callers pass a manifest
# explicitly in tests; in a live run it is the located one.
