# Beads holds the pure, testable logic behind bead.rb: unwrapping bd show's
# one-element array, splitting its single notes blob into entries and
# parsing the /implement-plan --loop note grammar out of them, unioning
# bd ready results for the --label-any workaround (beads#5358), and ranking
# /commit's bead-resolution candidates. bead.rb is the thin CLI that shells
# out via Sh and wires this module's results into the envelope. See
# docs/plans/260806-st-hzf-skill-mechanics-scripts.md Phase 3.
