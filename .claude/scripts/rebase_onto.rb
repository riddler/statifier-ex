# RebaseOnto is the shared rebase-with-repair block that /merge-request
# deferred to /refresh-worktree by prose cross-reference - defined once here
# so it cannot drift, and reused directly (as a library call, not shelled out
# to) by worktree_refresh.rb and, in a later phase, /merge-request's own
# script. See docs/plans/260806-st-hzf-skill-mechanics-scripts.md Phase 4.
#
# A conflict is always blocked with needs: "human", the conflicting files
# named. There is no resolve path - CLAUDE.md's authority table is explicit
# that resolving a rebase conflict unasked is unauthorized, so this script
# does not offer one even as dead code.
#
# Assumes `origin/main` has already been fetched by the caller: a standalone
# run does no fetch of its own (see #run), and worktree_refresh.rb fetches
# once for the whole sweep rather than once per worktree.
