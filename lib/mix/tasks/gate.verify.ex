defmodule Mix.Tasks.Gate.Verify do
  @shortdoc "Run the full quality gate and attest that the run was not narrowed"

  @moduledoc """
  Runs `mix quality` and attests that what it ran was the full gate.

  A green run is not by itself evidence of a green gate: `--profile loop`,
  `--test-scope changed`, `--quick` and `--skip` all produce one, and each of
  them checks less. ADR-0011 makes reporting such a run as a full gate a
  weakening of the gate; this task is how that claim gets checked rather than
  remembered.

  ## Usage

      mix gate.verify

  The run passes only when the report says `status: "ok"`, `scope: "all"`, no
  profile, and no stage skipped for a reason that names this run rather than the
  project. Exit status is 0 when it attests and 1 when it does not.

  A stage skipped for a project-level reason (`:sobelow not installed`,
  `disabled in .quality.exs`, a custom stage's own skip) is named in the output
  but does not fail the attestation: that is a gap in what the project checks at
  all, which a fuller run cannot close.
  """

  use Mix.Task

  # ExQuality's own distinction: these reasons name the run, everything else
  # names the project (`deps/ex_quality/usage-rules.md:102-105`).

  Runs the gate and reports the attestation instead of halting.

  `opts[:runner]` replaces the `mix quality` shell-out with a function of an
  argument list returning `{output, status}`, mirroring
  `Mix.Tasks.Test.Regression`, so tests drive this without a nested gate run.
